1. **Sales Trends Over Time**  
   - Seasonal peaks were identified in December 2020 and September 2021, likely due to promotional periods or holidays.  
   - There’s a notable drop in early 2022, indicating a possible decline in demand, inventory issues, or reduced marketing efforts.  

2. **Product Performance**  
   - Arabica and Robusta are the most frequently sold coffee types.
     - **Arabica** shows the highest fluctuation, possibly due to demand sensitivity or popularity.  
     - **Robusta** appears more stable but lower in volume.  
   - Liberica and Excelsa recorded lower sales, indicating niche appeal or low market visibility.

3. **Country-Level Sales Insights**  
   - The United States accounts for over 80% of total sales ($35,639), highlighting it as the dominant market.  
   - Ireland and the United Kingdom underperform in comparison—an opportunity for targeted market expansion and strategy localization.

4. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - The top 5 customers (the people who bought the most) only contributed $1,473 out of that $35,639 (total sales). This means the rest of the sales came from many other customers who each bought smaller amounts.  
   - **Allis Wilmore** stands out as the highest-value customer ($317), representing a candidate for loyalty rewards or exclusive offers.

5. **Behavioral Filters** (The dashboard includes filters for roast type, pack size, and loyalty card status, enabling dynamic segmentation.)  
   - **Impact of the loyalty card on purchasing behavior**  
     Customers who use loyalty cards contribute more to total sales and show stronger, more stable spending patterns over time ($19,174) compared to those without loyalty cards ($16,465).  
     **Suggestion**: Provide exclusive deals or personalized promotions to loyalty members to boost engagement even further. Consider digging deeper into how often loyalty customers buy — this could help fine-tune strategies like rewards or seasonal campaigns.

   - **Most popular roast type (Dark/Light/Medium) and Best-selling pack size**  
     ☕ **Light Roast**  
     - Main Coffee Type: Arabica  
     - Top Sizes: 0.2 kg, 0.5 kg  
     - **Insight**: Customers prefer mild and aromatic coffee in smaller sizes, indicating Light Roast is favored by new or casual drinkers.  
     - **Suggestion**: Launch a “Discovery Pack” — compact, giftable bundles designed to invite first-timers into the world of premium coffee.

     ☕ **Medium Roast**  
     - Main Bean: Mostly Arabica, with some Excelsa  
     - Popular Sizes: 0.5 kg, 1 kg  
     - **Insight**: Medium Roast is purchased across various sizes, indicating it's a versatile, everyday choice. The mix of beans adds flavor complexity.  
     - **Suggestion**: Promote as an all-purpose coffee. Market as an everyday choice with flexible sizes.

     ☕ **Dark Roast**  
     - Main Coffee Type: Robusta  
     - Top Sizes: 1 kg, 2 kg  
     - **Insight**: Dark Roast drinkers are dedicated and decisive, choosing intensity and buying in bulk — they know what they want.  
     - **Suggestion**: Launch a “Bold Series” with large-size options, bulk savings, and loyalty perks for your most passionate customers.

### 💡 Business Recommendations  
- Upsell to top customers through bundles, loyalty rewards, or exclusive coffee types.  
- Explore why U.S. sales are dominant and replicate strategies in underperforming regions like the UK.  
- Promote niche types (Liberica, Excelsa) through marketing to increase their share.  
- Investigate early 2022 drop—seasonal trend or underlying issue?
