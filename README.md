🔹 1. Sales Trends Over Time
•	Seasonal peaks were identified in December 2020 and September 2021, likely due to promotional periods or holidays.
•	There’s a notable drop in early 2022, indicating a possible decline in demand, inventory issues, or reduced marketing efforts.

🔹 2. Product Performance
•	Arabica and Robusta are the most frequently sold coffee types.
o	Arabica shows the highest fluctuation, possibly due to demand sensitivity or popularity.
o	Robusta appears more stable but lower in volume.
•	Liberica and Excelsa recorded lower sales, indicating niche appeal or low market visibility.

🔹 3. Country-Level Sales Insights
•	The United States accounts for over 80% of total sales ($35,639), highlighting it as the dominant market.
•	Ireland and the United Kingdom underperform in comparison—an opportunity for targeted market expansion and strategy localization.

🔹 4. Customer Segmentation
•	The top 5 customers (the people who bought the most) only contributed $1,473 out of that $35,639 (total sales). This means the rest of the sales came from many other customers who each bought smaller amounts.
•	Allis Wilmore stands out as the highest-value customer ($317), representing a candidate for loyalty rewards or or exclusive offers.

🔹 5. Behavioral Filters
•	The dashboard includes filters for roast type, pack size, and loyalty card status, enabling dynamic segmentation.
1.	Most popular roast type (Dark/Light/Medium).
2.	Best-selling pack size (1.0 kg may dominate due to value perception).
3.	Impact of the loyalty card on purchasing behavior (filter “Yes” vs “No”).

💡 Business Recommendations
•	Upsell to top customers through bundles, loyalty rewards, or exclusive coffee types.

•	Explore why U.S. sales are dominant and replicate strategies in underperforming regions like the UK.

•	Promote niche types (Liberica, Excelsa) through marketing to increase their share.

•	Investigate early 2022 drop—seasonal trend or underlying issue?
