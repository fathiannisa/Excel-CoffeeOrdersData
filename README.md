## 1. Sales Trends Over Time

•	Seasonal peaks were identified in December 2020 and September 2021, likely due to promotional periods or holidays.

•	There’s a notable drop in early 2022, indicating a possible decline in demand, inventory issues, or reduced marketing efforts.

## 2. Product Performance

•	Arabica and Robusta are the most frequently sold coffee types.

  a. Arabica shows the highest fluctuation, possibly due to demand sensitivity or popularity.
          
  b. Robusta appears more stable but lower in volume.
          
•	Liberica and Excelsa recorded lower sales, indicating niche appeal or low market visibility.

## 3. Country-Level Sales Insights

•	The United States accounts for over 80% of total sales ($35,639), highlighting it as the dominant market.
      
•	Ireland and the United Kingdom underperform in comparison—an opportunity for targeted market expansion and strategy localization.

## 4. Customer Segmentation

•	The top 5 customers (the people who bought the most) only contributed $1,473 out of that $35,639 (total sales). This means the rest of the sales came from many other customers who each bought smaller amounts.

•	Allis Wilmore stands out as the highest-value customer ($317), representing a candidate for loyalty rewards or or exclusive offers.

## 5. Behavioral Filters

•	The dashboard includes filters for roast type, pack size, and loyalty card status, enabling dynamic segmentation.

  a.	Most popular roast type (Dark/Light/Medium).
    
  b.	Best-selling pack size (1.0 kg may dominate due to value perception).
    
  c.	Impact of the loyalty card on purchasing behavior (filter “Yes” vs “No”).

💡 Business Recommendations

•	Upsell to top customers through bundles, loyalty rewards, or exclusive coffee types.

•	Explore why U.S. sales are dominant and replicate strategies in underperforming regions like the UK.

•	Promote niche types (Liberica, Excelsa) through marketing to increase their share.

•	Investigate early 2022 drop—seasonal trend or underlying issue?
